# 02_thermal_wearables

Project pack for portfolio site generation.

## Included
- `page.md` — public project page text (pre-publication safe)
- `captions.md` — image captions
- `notes_private.md` — private notes (do not publish)
- `images/` — images with standardized filenames
- `code/` — add your shareable Arduino + Python code here

## IMPORTANT: Redaction
`images/05_knitout_preview_redacted.png` is intentionally a **redacted** preview to avoid leaking the heater routing.
If you replace it with a different screenshot, make sure it does not reveal conductive-yarn topology.
